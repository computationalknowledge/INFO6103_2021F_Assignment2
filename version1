Any other number will be invalid.

Your Java Web service application will be one SOAP related code with two parts:

a)	Write a SOAP program in Java as a Web service that charges the credit card of a traveler that made a reservation for a particular trip. (Show message that it charged the credit card)
b)	Write a SOAP message in Java as a Web service that declines charging the credit card of a client due to an invalid card number.
